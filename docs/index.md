# About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 12 years of experience building scalable real-time communication systems and mobile/web infrastructure. I spent 9 years at **Google** as a core contributor and engineering leader on the **Google Chat** team, driving product growth from early stage to over 10x scale.

I am currently pivoting my focus to **AI/LLMs**, leveraging my background in distributed systems to build the next generation of AI agents and debugging tools.
